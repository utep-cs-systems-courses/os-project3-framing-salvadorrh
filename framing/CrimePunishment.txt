and what terrible suffering and what infinite happiness before them! But he
had risen again and he knew it and felt it in all his being, while she-she

On the evening of the same day, when the barracks were locked, Raskolnikov lay
on his plank bed and thought of her. He had even fancied that day that all the
convicts who had been his enemies looked at him differently; he had even

remembered that now, and thought it was bound to be so. Wasn't everything now
bound to be changed?

He thought of her. He remembered how continually he had tormented her and
wounded her heart. He remembered her pale and thin little face. But these
recollections scarcely troubled him now; he knew with what infinite love he
would now repay all her sufferings. And what were all, all the agonies of the
past! Everything, even his crime, his sentence and imprisonment, seemed to him
now in the first rush of feeling an external, strange fact with which he had
no concern.
